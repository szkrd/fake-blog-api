# Fake blog API

So far this is a mix between two repositories:

1. [Blog Fake API](https://github.com/matheusazzi/blog-fake-api) - fixture generation
2. [JSON server many to many](https://github.com/jimschubert/json-server-many-to-many) -
   a wrapper around json-server to let it handle many to many relations

I'm using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) now,
but this may change in the future.
